      <description>Cryptocurrency Candlestick Charts If you aren’t keen on finance or if you are new to these kinds of charts, as I was, I’ll explain them briefly:

      <description>I am a Research Analyst at Pew Research Center focusing mostly on survey and research methodology. This is a website where I will post data analyses of different areas that are interesting to me. It is important to know that this website does not, nor will ever, represent any views of my employer and the content posted here is solely my own.
I&amp;rsquo;m using blogdown and hugo to build the site.</description>
