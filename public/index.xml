      <description>If you aren’t keen on finance or if you are new to these kinds of charts, as I was, I’ll explain them briefly:
 Each individual bars represent a day. The low point of the bars represent the low-point for the coin that day and so forth for the high/high point. The coloring represents where the coin closed that day in respect to the prior day.</description>

      <title>Using tidyverse tools with Pew Research Center survey data in R</title>

      <description>What is the “tidyverse”? R is free and open-source software that anyone can contribute to. The most common kinds of contributions are collections of R code called packages. R packages are typically hosted on The Comprehensive R Archive Network (CRAN), but can also be found on other primarily open-source code repositories like github, gitlab, or bioconductor. The ability for anyone to be able to build an R package and contribute to R’s development is a key component of R’s utility, but with so many packages (13,581 packages on CRAN as of 12/27/18), there are often many different ways to tackle the same challenge.</description>

      <description>I am a Research Analyst at Pew Research Center focusing mostly on survey and research methodology. This is a website where I will post data analyses of different areas that are interesting to me. It is important to know that this website does not, nor will ever, represent any views of my employer and the content posted here is solely my own.
I&amp;rsquo;m using blogdown and hugo to build the site.</description>
