      <description>Nick Markakis’ defense is really, really bad.
That’s it, that’s the post.
A couple things stand out to me. Take the Astros and Yankees. The Astros have a hump at around 80 or so wrc+, but over half their team is &amp;gt;100 and is pretty evenly distributed up to the 150 or so range. The number of &amp;gt;150 wrc+ hitters in their lineup is unheard of across the league and is a big reason why they lead the league with the team average of 122.</description>

      <title>WRC&#43; Distributions</title>

      <description>Weighted Runs Created Plus or wrc+ is a nice stat for analyzing relative hitter performance for a certain year. It’s relative because it is scaled to every hitter in the league for that season.
So, an average hitter has a wrc+ of 100. This makes it interesting to look at a team’s wrc+ distribution to see how many good hitters they have.
You can see the league wrc+ distribution is fairly evenly distributed.</description>

      <description>Data from this post retreived via the fabulous baseballr package from Bill Petti.
It has a number of data acquisition and other functions. Here, I used the baseballr::scrape_savant_leaderboards() function to fetch data from the MLB’s baseball savant website for exit velocity as measured by Statcast.
The resulting dataset looks like:
barrels_15_19 %&amp;gt;% glimpse() ## Observations: 2,375 ## Variables: 19 ## $ year &amp;lt;int&amp;gt; 2015, 2015, 2015, 2015, 2015, 2015, 2015, … ## $ last_name &amp;lt;chr&amp;gt; &amp;quot;Stanton&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;Cruz&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;Trout&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;Gonzalez&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;R… ## $ first_name &amp;lt;chr&amp;gt; &amp;quot;Giancarlo&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;Nelson&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;Mike&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;Carlos&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;… ## $ player_id &amp;lt;dbl&amp;gt; 519317, 443558, 545361, 471865, 434670, 12… ## $ attempts &amp;lt;dbl&amp;gt; 187, 427, 422, 428, 334, 385, 377, 445, 24… ## $ avg_hit_angle &amp;lt;dbl&amp;gt; 15.</description>
