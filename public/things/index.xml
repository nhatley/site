      <description>What is the “tidyverse”? R is free and open-source software that anyone can contribute to. The most common kinds of contributions are collections of R code called packages. R packages are typically hosted on The Comprehensive R Archive Network (CRAN), but can also be found on other primarily open-source code repositories like github, gitlab, or bioconductor. The ability for anyone to be able to build an R package and contribute to R’s development is a key component of R’s utility, but with so many packages (13,581 packages on CRAN as of 12/27/18), there are often many different ways to tackle the same challenge.</description>
