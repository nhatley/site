I am a Research Analyst at Pew Research Center focusing mostly on survey and research methodology. This is a website where I will post data analyses of different areas that are interesting to me. It is important to know that this website does not, nor will ever, represent any views of my employer and the content posted here is solely my own.

I'm using [blogdown](https://github.com/rstudio/blogdown) and [hugo](https://gohugo.io/) to build the site. I highly recommend the [blogdown book](https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/) by Yihui Xie, Amber Thomas, and Alison Presmanes Hill. I came into this process knowing practically nothing about web design and was able to at least create a site after reading the book and a couple days of practice.

Everything is hosted on [github](https://github.com/nhatley), and the individual topics contain their own repositories if you want to pull some of the data or code for any of your own projects.

For now, repo's that may be of interest are:

- [NHL stats](https://github.com/nhatley/nhl_stats) -- data pulled from NHL's api. In this repo you can find scripts that pull and clean all kinds of different datasets. The API is actually very well done and you may be surprised about the range and quality of the data offered for free.
- [crypto](https://github.com/nhatley/crypto) -- Code and data for dealing with coinapi.io api with lots of historical data on different crypto currency prices.
- [Social Trust](https://github.com/nhatley/social_trust) -- Code and data for an analysis on trends in broad 'social trust' from 1972-current in the General Social Survey.

It's important to note that everything here is a work in progress is very likely to change. I encourage anyone to contact me if they find something that could be helpful to something they are doing as I know I have benefited greatly from the open-source society so I would love to pay some of that forward.
