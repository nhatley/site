<p>Nick Markakis’ defense is <strong>really, really</strong> bad.</p>
<p>That’s it, that’s the post.</p>

<p>A couple things stand out to me. Take the Astros and Yankees. The Astros have a hump at around 80 or so wrc+, but over half their team is &gt;100 and is pretty evenly distributed up to the 150 or so range. The number of &gt;150 wrc+ hitters in their lineup is unheard of across the league and is a big reason why they lead the league with the team average of 122. The Yankees on, the other hand, have almost no 150 or higher wrc+ hitters, but almost all of their hitters are above league average.</p>
